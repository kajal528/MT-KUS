# MT-KUS
This folder contains 3 python notebook:
1. MT_KUS_NHANES_Dataset
   This file contains complete implementation code used for hypertension prediction using NHANES dataset. The complete code is divided into 4 sections,
    a) Data Collection and Data Pre-processing
    b) K-means UnderSampling
    c) Model Training
    d) Result
    
2. undersampling.py
    We created a library named undersampling which contains the implemention code for K-means Under-Sampling (KUS). The motivation for creating this library
    is to make the future use of KUS approach easy.
    
3. KUS_library_testing
    This file contains the implementation code used for testing the undersampling library using nhanes, ecoli and pima dataset. We used Support Vector Machine 
    classifier for model training.
